        Mikaella is a student who's interested in different types of field and a conscious student who overthinks the future awaiting 
        for her. This made her wonder if having these bunch of goals is an advantage for her or if

    to providse for your needs and the love you need. My mother might not be the perfect person for everyone's eyes, but she is the one of the 
    most important perfect person for me. <br><br><br><br><br></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p> Graduating with your friends is one of the memorable things that you can do with them. It is the most important and joyful thing. 
        We're not just talking about how close you are with them, how many things you've done together, but it is also about being there when 
        someone needs the support of your ciercle. It is one of Mikaella's achievement to be with her friends on the venue, knowing that
        there are a lot of things that made them vulnerable, that almost drained them. <br><br></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>><br><br><br>

        equation and solve problems. <b> Ma'am Janette Frrera</b> is her 4th year adviser in junior highschool, she isn't just a "teacher" for her 
        students, she is also a mathematics teacher who loves to care for her students, the woman who molds her students to become a better version 
        of themselves. She is the one who really know Mikaella.
